## Controller Setup
### OSC Controllers
1. Ensure your wheels are connected to an OSC server that is running on the same network as your machine.
2. Match the `IP Address` and `Port` settings to your running OSC server.
3. Click `Save Settings`. In the main window, a grey `ERASE` field indicates WheelsTrainer's OSC Connection is closed. A green `STBY` field indicates the OSC Connection is open, but WheelsTrainer is not receiving any OSC messages. A red `REC` are indicates WheelsTrainer is receiving OSC messages and is updating the player's properties.

### Mouse-Style Controllers
1. Select "Mouse-Style" in Controller Settings
2. Click the green `STBY` field underneath the player to enter cursor capture mode. While in this mode, a red `REC` field will appear instead, indicating cursor capture mode is enabled. Moving the cursor to the left with pan the player's viewport in the same direction. Moving the cursor down will tilt the player's viewport in the same direction. Press the `Esc` key to return to `STBY` mode.
